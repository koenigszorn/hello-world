Hi Humans!

I like my coffee with caramel bisquits and I am interested in fantasy and sci-fi story. When a book got a map it can't score less than a C in my eyes. But there are exception from this rule. My favorite book so far is 'The Name of the wind' by Patrick Rothfuss. Great author, the language is poetry and the story is breathtaking. Marvelous!

Have fun and take care!
